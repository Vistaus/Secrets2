# Project Analysis: Secrets

This document outlines the initial analysis of the "Secrets" project, including a summary of existing repository contents, the inferred project purpose, and suggested next steps for development.

## 1. Repository Contents Summary

The repository currently contains the following files:

*   **`.gitattributes`**:
    *   Configured for auto-detection of text files and LF (Line Feed) normalization. This helps maintain consistent line endings across different operating systems.
*   **`LICENSE`**:
    *   The project is licensed under the MIT License, granting broad permissions for use, modification, and distribution.
*   **`README.md`**:
    *   Provides the project title: "Secrets - A clean interface for managing a pass repository."

## 2. Inferred Project Purpose and Goals

Based on the project description:

*   **Purpose**: The "Secrets" project aims to provide a user-friendly and streamlined interface for managing a `pass` repository (or a compatible password store). It intends to simplify interactions with stored passwords and other sensitive data.

*   **Key Goals**:
    *   **Enhanced User Experience (UX)**: Offer an intuitive, clean, and easy-to-use interface, potentially for command-line usage.
    *   **Abstraction & Simplification**: Hide some of the underlying complexities of the password store (e.g., direct GPG commands).
    *   **Security**: Ensure that the interface maintains the security of the managed secrets, building upon the robust encryption provided by the underlying `pass` utility (which uses GPG).
    *   **Seamless Integration**: Likely integrate smoothly with existing `pass` repositories and their structures.

## 3. Suggested Next Steps for Development

The following are concrete recommendations to begin development:

1.  **Establish Project Directory Structure**:
    *   `src/`: For core application logic and modules.
    *   `cmd/`: For the command-line interface entry point(s).
    *   `tests/`: For unit, integration, and other tests.
    *   `docs/`: For project documentation (user guides, API details, etc.).

2.  **Define and Outline Core Functionality Modules**:
    *   **`src/repository.[ext]`**:
        *   Functions for listing secrets.
        *   Functions for retrieving (decrypting) secrets.
        *   Functions for adding (encrypting) new secrets.
        *   Functions for editing existing secrets.
        *   Functions for deleting secrets.
    *   **`src/config.[ext]`**:
        *   Module for managing application configuration (e.g., path to the `pass` repository, default GPG key ID).
    *   **`cmd/cli.[ext]`**:
        *   Code for parsing command-line arguments.
        *   Functions to map CLI commands (e.g., `secrets list`, `secrets show <name>`) to the core repository functions.

3.  **Identify and Integrate Key Dependencies**:
    *   **GPG Interaction Library**: A library to interact with GnuPG for encryption and decryption operations (e.g., `python-gnupg` if using Python, or equivalent for other languages).
    *   **Command-Line Argument Parser**: A robust library to handle CLI arguments and subcommands.
    *   **Testing Framework**: A standard testing framework for the chosen programming language (e.g., `pytest` for Python).

4.  **Set Up Initial Development and Testing Tooling**:
    *   **Build Script/Utility Commands**: A `Makefile` or similar script for common development tasks (building, testing, linting).
    *   **Initial Unit Tests**: Start with basic tests for core functions in the `tests/` directory.
    *   **Code Linter and Formatter**: Integrate tools to enforce code style and quality (e.g., Flake8, Black for Python; ESLint, Prettier for JavaScript).
    *   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Consider setting up a basic CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) early on to automate testing and linting.
